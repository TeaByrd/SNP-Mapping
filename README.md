### This repo contains a list of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD) associated SNPs and a script/guide to extend and map those snps to genes called SNPs_Genes_Mapping.ipynb.

 - AD_SNPS.txt -> Alzheimer's Disease associated SNPs extracted from PheWAS and DisGeNet (curated only).
 - PD_SNPS.txt -> Parkinson's Disease associated SNPs extracted from PheWAS and DisGeNet (curated only).

 - SNPs_Genes_Mapping.ipynb -> Script Guide that takes the above mentioned seed SNPs and extends those with LD associated SNPs using Haploreg (4.1) and eQTLs from GTex Portal
